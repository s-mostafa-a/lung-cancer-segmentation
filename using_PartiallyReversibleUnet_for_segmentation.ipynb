        "Because 3d image size are in like this: (512,512,z) which z range is from 112 to 465, I thougth it would be good if I crop each 3D image from it's third axis (z) and fix that in a constant like 110. This way raw data loss becomes so little. for example if we have an image sized (512,512, 112) we would generate an image (512,512,110), Also if we had an image sized (512, 512, 373) we would generate 3 images with sizes (512,512,110) which it covers 330 out of 373 from z of original raw data.\n",
        "\n",
        "But when I used it with size (512,512,110), cuda went out of memory and it needed more RAM. Also I found some paper which they cropped this dataset's images to size (64,64,64)! which I thought their data loss would be so high. But anyway I went a way similar to their way and cropped original images to the size (110,110,110) which almost contains 8 times more data (and less data loss) from that paper.\n",

        "So I wrote below classes which use some features of [this code](https://github.com/jcreinhold/niftidataset). It used a single image 5 times and cropped each randomly, but I thought It will not be useful because np.random.seed() makes each time just one crop. officially it wouldn't help.\n"
